# Food-Waste-Reduction-and-Redistribution-System
Created a system to reduce food waste by labelling the food items as producing "High Waste" and "Low waste". It uses the Machine Learning model- Random Forest Classifier for the classification of the food items. The system asks the Donor to consider making modifications in the quantity of food being produced after analysing the statistical data. If still there's surplus food, a Nutritional analysis would be done to highlight the nutrients present in the surplus food. This would ensure that only nutritional food gets redistributed among the needy.  We maintain a database to connect the Donors with the surplus food, with the nearest NGOs who would redistribute the  food among the needy. Thus easing the process of finding the nearest Donors from whom the surplus food can be collected.
