# ReQbites: Food-Waste-Reduction-and-Redistribution-System

Problem: 
In a world grappling with the paradox of food scarcity and wastage, efficient management of surplus food has never been more compelling. The alarming scale of global food waste exacerbates the challenges of hunger, environmental degradation, and economic inefficiency. Addressing this pressing issue is paramount for creating a sustainable and equitable future for all.

Solution: Developed a robust and reliable Food Waste Reduction and Redistribution system to solve the above issue. It mainly focuses on 4 features: 
1) Food Waste Reduction: Utilizes Random Forest Classifier to categorize Surplus food as producing High or Low waste- Takes food item as user input- Predicts and notifies the Donor if the food item is classified as producing High waste- An attempt to reduce the amount of surplus food generated- Reduced Food Wastage.
   
2)Nutritional Analysis: Displays Nutrient Content of the Surplus food- Enables prior analysis ensuring that only nutrient-rich food is donated to the needy. 

3)Optimized Distribution Mechanism: Geographical mapping of the nearest Donors to a particular Recipient(NGO) - Shortest path calculation using Minimum Spanning Tree technique- Visual Representation of the original weighted Graph and the Optimized Graph- Aids in planning effective routes-Reduces transportation costs and time- Lowers carbon footprints through optimized routes.

4) Real-time Database Connectivity: Efficiently connects donors producing surplus food with nearby NGOs- streamlines the redistribution process, enhancing the timely and targeted delivery of surplus food to those who need it most.
   
Apart from these features, this project also empowers the user to stay updated about how addition of new data in the database affects the Model accuracy alongwith the Cross-Validation Score to prevent instances of Overfitting.
